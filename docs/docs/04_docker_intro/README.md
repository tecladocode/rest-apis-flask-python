# An Introduction to Docker

:::caution Not a Docker course
An important foreword: this is not a Docker course, and I'm not a Docker expert!

In this section, and in later sections of this course, I'll teach you what Docker is and how to use it to run and deploy your Flask apps. However, I won't teach you everything there is to know about Docker!

Docker is a software framework for building, running, and managing **images** and **containers**.

In order to understand Docker, you need to clarify two questions:

- What are Docker containers, and how are they different to Virtual Machines?
- What are Docker images?

After this, you'll be ready to create your own Docker images and use those images to create and run containers.

Let's take a look at Docker containers in the next lecture!

# Python Refresher

We've included a Python Refresher section in this course to help you, in case you haven't done any Python for a while or you are coming from a different programming language.

There are no written notes for this section, but all the videos are available in the Udemy course.

If you are fully new to programming _and_ Python, this course may be a bit advanced. Feel free to read through out beginner Python e-book anyway, as it might be helpful: [https://python.tecladocode.com](https://python.tecladocode.com).

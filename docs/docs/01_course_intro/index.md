# REST APIs with Flask and Python

Hi, and welcome!

REST APIs with Flask and Python is a complete course that teaches you how to develop complete, professional REST APIs using **Flask**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**.

In this website you can find the complete course notes and code. We made this to help students navigate the course more easily. Also, every single piece of code we write in the course is in the notes, with brief explanations.

We've found that really helps review the course content later on!

This is how we recommend taking the course:

- Start at the first section of the course, and watch the videos. If you're comfortable, watch them in 1.25x or 1.5x speed! This will help you understand the content holistically.
- Then, re-watch the videos slowly while coding together with me. Write every piece of code by hand, just as you see it in the videos. By the time you're done with a section, after writing all the code, you'll be very comfortable with all the content in it.
- Move onto the next section, but keep the code from each section in a different folder. That way you can then look at the full project as it was at the end of each section, and that will help you review!

I promise that if you follow this approach, you will master the content of this course within a few weeks. And you'll soon be able to code complete REST APIs using Flask and Python!

:::tip Note-taking not required
Feel free to take notes while you go through the course, but you don't need to!

This very website is a perfect set of notes for you to come back to weeks, months, or even years down the line to review what you learned in the course (and, let's be honest, find those snippets of code that you can just copy into your projects).

## Course Set-up and Housekeeping

Below are some quick guides to get you started. Feel free to read through them if you need, or skip them!

After this, we have a [Python Refresher](../02_python_refresher/index.md). If you are very comfortable with Python, feel free to skip that too!

If you're skipping the Python Refresher, move onto Your First REST API.

I'll see you there!

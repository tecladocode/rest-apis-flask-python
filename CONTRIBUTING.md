# How to contribute to this course

## E-book contributions

### How to run the e-book

Clone the repo and navigate to the `docs` folder.

There, run:

```
npm install
```

Then you can run the e-book with:

```
npm run start
```

If you make any changes to the e-book, please keep changes as simple as possible and create a PR with your changes into the `develop` branch.

If you are making larger changes, please create a Discussion first and let's talk about it!

### Making changes to projects

All the finished projects that we cover in the course are in the `projects` folder. Making changes to these projects is done very carefully, especially after recording.

Please start a Discussion before making any changes, as doing so can make the experience for students confusing (if the videos and e-book are different).
